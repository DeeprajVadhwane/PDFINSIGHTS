# PDF Insight - Conversational RAG with PDF Including Chat History

## Project Description

PDF Insight is an interactive tool designed to enhance the learning experience by enabling users to engage in a conversational interface with their PDF documents. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, this application allows you to upload PDFs and ask questions related to the content. The system retrieves the relevant information from the document, contextualizes the queries using chat history, and provides concise answers.

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced educational and professional environments, individuals often struggle to quickly extract relevant information from large documents like textbooks, research papers, and notes. Traditional methods of reading and studying are time-consuming, leading to frustration and reduced productivity. There is a need for a solution that not only provides quick and accurate answers but also makes the learning process more interactive and engaging. PDF Insight addresses this need by allowing users to chat with their documents, retrieving and summarizing key information on demand.
